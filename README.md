This repository is a seed for writing NPM packages with ES6 syntax using [babel](https://babeljs.io/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project to your workspace:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sampathsris/npm-babel-seed.git your-package-name
    ```
2. Edit `package.json` to contain the correct package name, version, etc...
3. Do some coding in the `src` directory.
4. `npm run compile`

ES5 sources will be generated in the `lib` directory.
